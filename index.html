                    <!-- <p></p> -->
                    <p>Ministry of Heath of Turkey has a rabies guideline booklet that describes approptiate approches
                        for patients suspected of a rabies virus exposure. Post exposure profilaxis(PEP) is the most
                        important part. While this booklet has a summary table for PEP as well as an algorithmic
                        diagram, in my clinical practice I realized that they are not optimized for real life cases and
                        they don't cover all situations that described in the booklet. I thought that a better and more
                        comprehensive algorithm may be created and it would be even better to have an app that follows
                        that algorithm step by step. So I created this single page app. </p>
                    <p>Main aim of this app is that by answering multiple choice questions one by one to reach the
                        correct treatment with lowest effort and maximum precision. I also included;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vaccine dose dates that calculated for the current date</li>
                        <li>A calculator that takes weigth of the patient and immunglobulin type(human or horse derived)
                            and outputs the correct amount to administer</li>
                        <li>Short notes about current step that toggled with clicking the title</li>
                        <li>An info popup that has a navbar for easy navigation</li>
                        <li>A cool animation between steps and sci-fi like theme that may be regarded totally
                            unnecessary (lol)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Content is in Turkish because countries have different guidelines on this topic so it is not
                        universal but local info. But coding part such as variable names, class names and comments are
                        mostly in English. </p>

                    <p>Like the rabies app this app takes to the recommended treatment with answering a question in each
                        step. Rabies prophylaxis is much more complex than this one. This one has a relaxing fade-out-in
                        animation. Content is in Turkish.</p>

                    <p>This was my first small project. In each level, the sum of 2 random numbers between a
                        predetermined range is asked and must be answered in the given time limit that counts down on
                        the screen. You can also change the number range and time limit. Scores are saved in local
                        storage so they persist as long as browser data is not cleaned. I also added little animations
                        that activate after some time when game is not being played. </p>

                        There are formal guides for planning the treatment. It takes patient anemia level and patient
                        weigh outputs the doses for 2 different medications. I aimed this to be more interactive and it
                        is possible to change the each dose and calculate the corresponding weight. (You may wonder what
                        the weight must be to prescribe a particular dose)</p>

                        is aimed to be realistic calculation-wise, for example an object fall from 80 meters in 4
                        seconds in accordance with:</p>
                    <code> X = (1/2)*(a.t^2) ; a = g = 10 m/(s^2)  </code>
                    <code>  80 = (10/2)*(t^2) ; 16 = (t^2) ; t = 4 </code>
                    <p>Not compatible with mobile devices. Uses keyboard input.</p>
