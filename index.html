                    <h3><a href="https://drot2579.github.io/kdz/" target="_blank">Rabies Profilaxis App</a></h3>

                    <p>Ministry of Heath of Turkey has a rabies guideline booklet that describes approptiate approches
                        for
                        patients suspected of a rabies virus exposure. Post exposure profilaxis(PEP) is the most
                        important
                        part. While this booklet has a summary table for PEP as well as an algorithmic diagram, in my
                        clinical practice I realized that they are not optimized for real life cases and they don't
                        cover
                        all situations that described in the booklet. I thought that a better and more comprehensive
                        algorithm may be created and it would be even better to have an app that follows that algorithm
                        step by step. So I created this single page app. </p>
                    <p>Main aim of this app is that by answering multiple choice questions one by one to reach the
                        correct
                        treatment with lowest effort and maximum precision. I also included;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vaccine dose dates that calculated for the current date</li>
                        <li>A calculator that takes weigth of the patient and immunglobulin type(human or horse derived)
                            and
                            outputs the correct amount to administer</li>
                        <li>Short notes about current step that toggled with clicking the title</li>
                        <li>An info popup that has a navbar for easy navigation</li>
                        <li>A cool animation between steps and sci-fi like theme that may be regarded totally unnecessay
                            (lol)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Content is in Turkish because countries have different guidelines on this topic so it is not
                        universal but local info. But coding part such as variable names, class names and comments are
                        mostly in English. </p>
                    <p>The app can be opened by clicking the title.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://drot2579.github.io/td/" target="_blank">Tetanus profilaxis app</a></h3>
                    <p>Like the rabies app this app takes to the recommended treatment with answering a question in each
                        step. Rabies prophylaxis is much more complex than this one. This one has a relaxing fade-out-in
                        animation. Content is in Turkish.</p>

                            Simulation</a></h3>
                    <p>I looked into the canvas tag and I tought I could make a Newton mechanics(F = m.a) simulator. It
                        is
                        aimed to be realistic calculation-wise, for example an object fall from 80 meters in 4 seconds
                        in
                        accordance with:</p>
                    <code> X = (1/2)(a.t^2) |--| a = g = 10 m/(s^2)  </code>
                    <code>  80 = (10/2).(t^2) |--| 16 = (t^2) ; t = 4 </code>

                    <h3><a href="https://drot2579.github.io/mathGame1/" target="_blank">Basic Math Game</a></h3>
                    <p>This was my first small project. In each level, the sum of 2 random numbers between a
                        predetermined range is asked and must be answered in the given time limit that counts down on
                        the screen. You can also change the number range and time limit. Scores are saved in local
                        storage so they persist as long as browser data is not cleaned. I also added little animations
                        that activate after some time when game is not being played.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://drot2579.github.io/esa/" target="_blank">ESA Drug Dose Calculator</a></h3>
                    <p>Erytropoesis Stimulating Agents(ESA) are used for the anemia in chronic renal disease patients.
                        There
                        are formal guides for planning the treatment. It takes patient anemia level and patient weigh
                        outputs the doses for 2 different medications. I aimed this to be more interactive and it is
                        possible to change the each dose and calculate the corresponding weight. (You may wonder what
                        the
                        weight must be to prescribe a particular dose)</p>
